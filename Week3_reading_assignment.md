In my opinion, open street map data is such a creative idea to allow more people to participate in mapping even under the pandemic. 
As Rachel Levine explained, I like that not only local people or professional humanitarian workers but also international non-professional volunteers can participate in creating the data. 
When I first began the remote volunteer for open street map last year, I did not have knowledge about mapping. 
However, this volunteer is one of the reasons why I started to be more interested in mapping and spatial analysis. 
Moreover, the data would be useful for not only humanitarian organizations but also scholars who are looking for international geographical data and demographical data. 
For my project, I hope to use open data to visualize the inequality of impact of disasters in the world.
