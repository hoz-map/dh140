I really enjoyed reading this article.
These days, I see a lot of news and documentaries talking about how social media companies misuse user information and data and tend to have a negative impression towards social media. 
However, this article reminds me how social media can bring a positive impact on society. 
As the author mentioned, social technologies can be a tool to give voice to people, like the example of the 2011 revolution in Egypt.
In addition, the example of sentiment analysis for the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake was very interesting to me. 
Disasters can bring a very negative impact on the mental health condition of many people.
Unstable or unhealthy mental health conditions can also influence people's life and career.
For example, I read the article about an old teen boy who lost his mother to the tsunami in 2011 when he was in the sixth grade of elementary school.
His trauma of the earthquake and tsunami and the loss of a loved one affected his mental health. 
However, due to insufficient professional mental health support, he had struggled with depression for a long time and dropped out of high school.
Therefore, I think the sentiment analysis of Twitter after a disaster would be helpful for creating a post-disaster mental health support program and preventing people from prolonged mental health issues as the old teenage boy experienced.
In terms of questions, there are two questions I would like to ask to researchers.
The first one is why did the researchers choose Twitter for social media analysis?
The second one is since Facebook is the most popular social media today([Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/)), would the researcher use facebook for analysis for social media analysis?
