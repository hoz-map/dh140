 I pick the article “[Which Covid-19 Data Can You Trust?](https://hbr.org/2020/05/which-covid-19-data-can-you-trust)” written by Satchit Balsari, Caroline Buckee, and Tarun Khanna from the Harvard Business Review. According to this article, some Covid-19 data, including national metrics of physical distancing and contact tracing data, are over-aggregated or too limited as well as provided by lack of expertise or reliability. The authors also suggest the importance of transparency, thoughtfulness, and open platforms for data. This is because the opened data allows people, including other researchers, to review, suggest, and check the data and prevents data providers from missing information.
