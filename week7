I really enjoyed reading this article.
These days, I see a lot of news and documentaries talking about how social media companies misuse user information and data and tend to have a negative impression towards social media. 
However, this article reminds me how social media can bring a positive impact on society. 
As the author mentioned, social technologies can be a tool to give voice to people, like the example of the 2011 revolution in Egypt.
There are two questions I would like to ask to researchers.
The first question is why did the researchers choose Twitter for social media analysis?
The second question is since Facebook is the most popular social media today according to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/), would the researcher use facebook for analysis for social media analysis?
